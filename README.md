# How do I interpret user needs and implement them into a program? 
To understand what users need, you turn those needs into specific features for the software.
Using user stories makes it easier to grasp what users want in a straightforward way.

# How does creating “user stories” help with this?
User stories play a vital role by making user needs crystal clear and easy to understand. 
They ensure everyone knows who needs what and why, which helps teams collaborate effectively.

# How do I approach developing programs? 
When developing software, follow Agile methods: understand user needs, break down work into smaller tasks,
prioritize important tasks, test and improve often, and update the software regularly based on feedback.

# What agile processes do I hope to incorporate into my future development work?
In my development process, I will consider using methods like Scrum (with sprints and regular check-ins),
Kanban (keeping work flowing smoothly), and find ways to incorporate CI/CD (automating updates) to stay efficient 
and flexible.


# What does it mean to be a good team member in software development?
Being a good team member means communicating openly and clearly, collaborating with your team, being adaptable 
to change, solving problems creatively, and taking responsibility for your work and deadlines.
